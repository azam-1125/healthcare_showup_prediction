## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes healthcare appointment data to predict patient no-shows and identify key factors contributing to missed appointments. By leveraging **machine learning** (Python) and **business intelligence** (Power BI), healthcare facilities can optimize scheduling, reduce resource waste, and improve patient care.

### Key Objectives
- Predict the likelihood of patient no-shows
- Identify risk factors associated with missed appointments
- Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards
- Enable data-driven decision-making for healthcare operations

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

**Data Analysis & Machine Learning:**
- Python 3.x
- pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization

**Business Intelligence:**
- Microsoft Power BI - Interactive dashboard creation
- DAX - Data modeling and calculations

### Machine Learning Pipeline

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Key preprocessing steps implemented:
- Missing value check (no missing values found)
- Boolean conversion to numeric (0/1)
- Date feature engineering
- Outlier detection and removal (negative Date.diff values)
```

#### 2. Feature Engineering

**Temporal Features:**
- `AppointmentWeekday` - Day of week (0-6)
- `AppointmentMonth` - Month number
- `ScheduledHour` - Hour when appointment was scheduled
- `Date.diff` - Days between scheduling and appointment

**Categorical Features:**
- `Gender_Encoded` - Gender encoding (F=0, M=1)
- `AgeGroup` - Age categories (0-18, 19-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60+)

**Historical Features:**
- `TotalAppointments` - Patient's total appointments
- `TotalShow_ups` - Patient's total show-ups
- `Show_Up_Rate` - Patient's historical show-up rate

**Risk Segmentation:**
- `Date_diff_Group` - Appointment lead time categories
- `RiskCategory` - Patient risk classification (Low/Medium/High)

#### 3. Model Development

**Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier

**Hyperparameters:**
```python
DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=8,
    min_samples_split=100,
    min_samples_leaf=50,
    random_state=42
)
```

**Training Configuration:**
- Train-test split: 80-20
- Random state: 42 (for reproducibility)

**Model Output:**
- `Predicted_Show_up` - Binary prediction (0/1)
- `Show_up_Probability` - Probability score (0-1)
- `RiskCategory` - Risk classification based on probability thresholds

## üìä Key Findings

### Overall Statistics
- **Average Show-up Rate**: 79.77%
- **Average No-Show Rate**: 20.23%
- **Total Appointments**: 106,987
- **Unique Patients**: 60,270

### Critical Insights

#### 1. SMS Reminders Paradox
- **No-Show Rate WITH SMS**: 27.67%
- **No-Show Rate WITHOUT SMS**: 16.73%
- **Interpretation**: SMS reminders were likely sent to high-risk patients, not randomly distributed

#### 2. Age Distribution
The dataset shows variation in show-up probability across age groups:
- Children (0-18): Lower show-up rates (dependent on parent schedules)
- Young Adults (19-30): Moderate show-up rates
- Middle Age (31-60): Higher show-up rates
- Seniors (60+): Highest show-up rates

#### 3. Appointment Lead Time
- **Same-day appointments**: Highest show-up rates
- **1-7 days**: Moderate no-show risk
- **8-30 days**: Increased no-show risk
- **31+ days**: Highest no-show risk

#### 4. Risk Categories Distribution
- **Low Risk** (>80% show-up probability): ~68% of appointments
- **Medium Risk** (50-80% probability): ~27% of appointments
- **High Risk** (<50% probability): ~5% of appointments

#### 5. Day of Week Patterns
Weekday appointments show different patterns, with specific days having higher no-show rates (visible in dashboard)
